1. /*
         public Rect (int left, int top, int right, int bottom)
         Create a new rectangle with the specified coordinates. Note: no range
         checking is performed, so the caller must ensure that left <= right and
         top <= bottom.

         Parameters
         left : The X coordinate of the left side of the rectangle
         top : The Y coordinate of the top of the rectangle
         right : The X coordinate of the right side of the rectangle
         bottom : The Y coordinate of the bottom of the rectangle

2. /* The Canvas class holds the "draw" calls.
     To draw something, you need 4 basic components: A Bitmap to hold the pixels,
     a Canvas to host the draw calls (writing into the bitmap),
     a drawing primitive (e.g. Rect, Path, text, Bitmap),
     and a paint (to describe the colors and styles for the drawing).

3. /* A class that implements Runnable can run without subclassing Thread by
    instantiating a Thread instance and passing itself in as the target. In most cases, the
    Runnable interface should be used if you are only planning to
    override the run() method and no other Thread methods.
     */

    /* When an object implementing interface Runnable is used to create a thread,
    starting the thread causes the object's run method to be called
    in that separately executing thread.
     */

    // Using Runnable, so need to implement run()
    // From documentation: The class must define a method of no arguments called run.
    // calls three methods also defined in this class
